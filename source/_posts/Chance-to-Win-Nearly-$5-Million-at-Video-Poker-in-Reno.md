#  Chance to Win Nearly $5 Million at Video Poker in Reno

The Golden Nugget in Reno is currently offering a chance to win nearly $5 million playing video poker. The top prize is a $4.9 million progressive jackpot, which has been hit only once since the game debuted there in March 2017.

Other jackpots are available as well, including a $100,000 payout for hitting four aces on a video poker machine. In order to be eligible for any of the progressive jackpots, players must insert $20 into the machines.

The Golden Nugget is one of several casinos in Reno that offer video poker games. Other casinos include Atlantis Resort and Casino, Peppermill Resort Spa Casino and Silver Legacy Resort Casino. All of these casinos have various types of video poker games available, with different pay tables and denominations.

Video poker has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its combination of simplicity and strategic depth. Unlike slot machines, which rely entirely on luck, video poker players can increase their chances of winning by making smart decisions about which cards to keep and discard.

Casinos offer a variety of pay tables for different levels of risk-tolerance and profitability. For example, the Jacks or Better pay table pays out 99.54% if all five coins are wagered, while the Double Bonus pay table pays out 99.11% with the same bet size. Players should always research the different pay tables before playing so they can find the best one for their bankroll and playing style.

Video poker can be played at home on a personal computer or laptop, or in live casinos across the United States. Online versions typically have lower stakes than live versions, but offer more options for bet sizes and game variations.

#  Video Poker Players Rewarded at Boomtown Reno

Players at the Boomtown Reno Casino were recently rewarded with a promotion that gave them free play and $10 in food vouchers. The promotion, which was announced on the casino’s Facebook page, ran from November 1-4 and was open to all players who earned at least 100 points on their player card.

According to the post, players could earn points by playing slots, video poker, or table games. In addition, players who redeemed comp dollars for food received an extra $10 in food vouchers.

The free play and food vouchers were a welcomed reward for the casino’s players. In fact, many of them took to social media to express their appreciation.

“Thanks for the free play Boomtown! I love you!,” wrote one player on the casino’s Facebook page.

Another player wrote, “Thank you Boomtown for the great promotion! I had a lot of fun and ate well too!”

The free play and food vouchers are just one of the many perks that Boomtown Reno offers its players. In addition to monthly promotions like this one, the casino also offers a variety of online and slot tournaments, as well as exclusive member discounts on hotel stays and dining.

#  Video Poker Payback Hits 99 Percent at Reno Casino

People looking to play video poker at a Reno casino can now do so knowing they'll be getting close to the best odds in the business. Atlantis Casino Resort Spa announced this week that it has upgraded its video poker payback to 99 percent, making it one of just two casinos in Nevada to offer such a high return percentage.

The news was met with celebration by video poker fans in the area, who have long lamented the fact that Reno's other big casinos offer far lower paybacks on their machines. Harrah's Reno, for example, offers a payback percentage of just 93.5 percent, while Eldorado Resort Casino only pays back 94.8 percent of money wagered.

"We are always looking for ways to improve our guests' experience," said Paul Pusey, vice president and general manager at Atlantis Casino Resort Spa. "Offering a 99 percent payback on our video poker machines is one way we can do that."

This isn't the first time Atlantis has made headlines with its video poker offerings; in 2013 the casino became the first in the state to offer machines with 100 percent payback percentages. At that time, however, there were only four such machines on site; this week's announcement means that nearly half of Atlantis' video poker machines now offer players the best possible odds.

What is it about Atlantis Casino Resort Spa that allows it to consistently offer some of the best odds in Reno? Part of it may simply be due to good luck; as mentioned, it is one of just two casinos in Nevada to offer a payback percentage of 99 percent or higher on video poker machines. But the casino has also taken steps to make sure its machines are properly tuned and maintained, regularly checking them for glitches and errors that could cause players to lose out on potential winnings.

Atlantis also offers a wide variety of different types of video poker games, from traditional single-hand games all the way up to multi-hand variations with up to 100 hands playing at once. This variety helps keep players engaged and gives them more opportunities to win (and thereby increase the casino's overall payback percentage).

So if you're headed to Reno in the near future, be sure to stop by Atlantis Casino Resort Spa and try your hand at one of its many video poker games! You may just come away a winner.
