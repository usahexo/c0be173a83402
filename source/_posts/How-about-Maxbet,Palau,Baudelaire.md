#  How about Maxbet,Palau,Baudelaire?

In the early nineteenth century, Charles Baudelaire bridged the gap between Symbolism and Romanticism. In his book of poetry Flowers of Evil, he wrote about various taboo subjects with innovative new techniques that would come to be known as Symbolism. Baudelaire was one of the first writers to explore the inner workings of the subconscious mind, and many of his poems are written in a stream-of-consciousness style.
