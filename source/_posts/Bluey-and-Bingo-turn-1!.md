#  Bluey and Bingo turn 1!

This month, Bluey and Bingo turn 1!

To celebrate their birthday, we’re taking a look back at some of our favourite moments from the past year.

We’ve laughed, we’ve cried (well, Bluey has) and we’ve learnt a lot – all thanks to these two little bundles of joy.

Without further ado, let’s take a look back at some of Bluey and Bingo’s best moments over the past year!

#1 When Bluey met Bingo for the first time

Although they wouldn’t technically meet until episode 2, the moment that Bluey was born was one that we all remember. From the adorable way he reached out his hand to touch Bingo to the way he cried when Bingo left – it was clear that these two were going to be best friends.

#2 When they played together in the park

Whether they were playing catch or just lying in the sun together, there was something so special about watching Bluey and Bingo play together. They may only be 1 year old but they have already formed an unbreakable bond.

#3 When they both learned how to walk

It was amazing watching both Bluey and Bingo learn how to walk – and seeing the joy on their faces as they took their first steps. Watching them explore the world around them is something that never fails to bring a smile to our faces.


#4 When Bluey started crawling

Once Bluey started crawling, things got a lot more interesting (and mayhem-filled) around the house! From finding random objects hidden under the couch to raiding the fridge when we weren’t looking, nothing was safe from Bluey once he started crawling.

#  Bluey and Bingo hit one year milestone at Royal Panda

Bluey and Bingo, two of the most popular animals at the Royal Panda casino, have just celebrated their first anniversary. The furry friends have entertained players and staff alike with their playful antics over the past twelve months.

Bluey is a grey house cat who loves to sunbathe and spend time with her human companions. Bingo is a mischievous black labrador retriever who loves to play fetch and eat treats. The pair have become firm favourites among players and staff at the casino, and can often be found cuddling together or licking each other’s faces.

Royal Panda spokesperson Mark Pifko said: “It’s been wonderful to see Bluey and Bingo develop such a close bond over the past year. They’ve brought a lot of joy to everyone at the casino and we look forward to seeing more of their adorable antics in the future!”

To mark their first anniversary, Bluey and Bingo were treated to special birthday cake made out of salmon, chicken, beef and rice. The cake was specially designed to be low in calories and suitable for both cats and dogs.

Bluey and Bingo are just two of the many animal friends who can be found at Royal Panda. Other residents include Bubbles, a brown sugar hamster, Harley, a black-and-white guinea pig, and Optimus Prime, a blue-eyed Siamese cat.

#  Bluey and Bingo: One Year Old and Still Going Strong

Bluey and Bingo are one year old today, and they show no signs of slowing down. The Staffordshire bull terriers are as playful as ever, always getting into mischief together.

"They're like two peas in a pod," says Bluey's owner, James. "If one is up, the other is sure to be close by."

The inseparable duo have become online sensations, with their own Instagram account (@blueyandbingo) boasting over 11,000 followers. From playing in the park to cuddling on the sofa, there's never a dull moment when Bluey and Bingo are around.

"I can't imagine life without them now," James says. "They've brought so much joy into our lives."

Happy birthday, Bluey and Bingo! Here's to many more fun-filled years together.

#  Royal Panda's Bluey and Bingo turn one

Today, Royal Panda's Bluey and Bingo turn one! To commemorate this momentous occasion, we're taking a look back at their first year.

Bluey and Bingo are two of Royal Panda's youngest residents. The cubs were born on 21 May 2017 and welcomed to the world by their mother, Rani.

The early days were a learning process for everyone involved. Bluey and Bingo were constantly exploring their surroundings and testing their boundaries. But with the help of mom Rani, they soon learned how to drink from a bottle, use the litter box, and play with each other.

 Slowly but surely, Bluey and Bingo started growing up. They gained weight, developed their own personalities, and became more adventurous. As they neared their first birthday, they even started trying new foods - including bamboo!

Bluey is the more daring of the two cubs. She loves to explore her territory and is always up for a new challenge. Her mischievous side often gets her into trouble (remember when she got stuck in the drain?), but it's also what makes her so much fun to watch.

Bingo is the quieter one of the duo. He loves spending time with mom Rani and playing with his brother and sister. He's also very food-motivated, which has helped him put on some healthy weight over the last year.

Royal Panda is incredibly proud of Bluey and Bingo's accomplishments in their first year. Here's to many more happy years ahead!
