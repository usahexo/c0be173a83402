#  PokerStars Unveils Plans for Full Home in Poker United States 

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, PokerStars officials made a surprise announcement declaring their plans to acquire an online poker license in the United States. This new development marks a dramatic shift in the company’s strategy, and will allow them to offer real-money online poker games to US players for the first time in over seven years.

As part of the company’s plans, PokerStars has announced that it will be launching a new product called “PokerStars Casino” which will offer casino games in addition to poker. This move is likely an attempt to shore up support from regulators who may be hesitant to issue a license to an online poker operator.

The news comes as a pleasant surprise for the US poker community, who have been eagerly awaiting the return of PokerStars ever since Black Friday hit in April 2011. That day saw PokerStars, along with several other leading online poker operators, forcibly shut down by the US Department of Justice.

Since that time, the market for online poker in the United States has been dominated by smaller operators such as Winning Poker Network and Americas Cardroom. These companies have been able to take advantage of a lack of competition by offering fewer features and less attractive bonuses than PokerStars.

With PokerStars now back in the picture, it is likely that we will see a renewed interest in online poker from American players. In anticipation of this, several of the smaller operators have already begun hiking up their prices in order to stay competitive.

It remains to be seen whether or not PokerStars will be successful in obtaining a license from US regulators. However, if they are successful, it is likely that they will quickly become the dominant player in the US market once again.

#  California Gambling Commission Approves PokerStars' Plan for Full Home in Poker United States 

PokerStars has been given the go ahead by the California Gambling Commission to operate a full fledged online poker room in the United States, following a detailed plan submission and presentation from Amaya Gaming, PokerStars’ parent company.

The unanimous vote by the five commissioners marks another significant step in PokerStars’ journey back to the US market, after an absence of nearly six years. The company is already operational in New Jersey through its partnership with Resorts Casino Hotel and will be seeking licenses in additional states in the coming months.

“We are grateful for the California Gambling Commission’s approval of our licensing application,” said Eric Hollreiser, PokerStars Interim Head of Corporate Communications. “We look forward to providing Californians with world-class poker products and customer service as we work to rebuild trust and confidence in our brand.”

The news was broadly welcomed by the poker community, with many expressing optimism that PokerStars will once again become a major player in the US market.

Commenting on the news, Daniel Negreanu said: “I'm really happy about this announcement. It's been a long time coming and there is still some work to do, but I am very confident that Amaya is going to make things right for all of us who love the game of poker. I can't wait to start playing on PokerStars again."
