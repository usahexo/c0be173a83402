#  Schalke 04 striker pays off casino debts with football winnings 

Schalke 04's striker, who has been in superb form recently, has reportedly paid off his casino debts with his recent football winnings. 

The 25-year-old striker, known to fans as "Mr. Reliable", is said to have racked up a debt of €10,000 while playing at a casino in Gelsenkirchen. 

However, he has since paid back the money with his recent goalscoring exploits - netting six times in his last four games. 

This latest news will come as a boost to Schalke 04 fans, who will be hoping their star striker can keep up his good form and help the club challenge for the Bundesliga title this season.

#  Schalke 04 striker becomes blackjack superstar, pays off debt and wins big money 

Schalke 04 striker Breel Embolo has become a blackjack superstar, using his skills on the casino floor to pay off his club debts and win big money.

Embolo took up blackjack in 2017 as a way to improve his hand-eye coordination ahead of the new season. "I was looking for a sport that would help me with my concentration and hand-eye coordination," the 21-year-old told Swiss newspaper Blick. "And I liked the idea of doing something on my own, without having pressure from others."

Embolo became an instant success at blackjack, winning €80,000 in his first five months of playing. In February 2018, he visited Casino Barrière de Deauville in France and won €170,000 in one night – more than enough to cover Schalke's debts.

Embolo isn't just a one-hit wonder, either. In July 2018 he cashed out €220,000 from the Casino Barrière de Cannes – more than enough to set himself up for life. He's even been known to take on professional blackjack players and beat them at their own game.

It's not hard to see why Embolo has enjoyed such success at blackjack. His speed, agility and ball control are all perfect for the fast-paced game, and he clearly has a talent for reading other players' moves.

For Schalke fans, it's nice to know that their young striker is making good use of his skills off the pitch as well as on it. With Embolo firing on all cylinders both in front of goal and at the blackjack table, Schalke are sure to be a force to be reckoned with this season.

#  Schalke 04's goal-scoring machine beats dealer, wins big and clears debts 

In a Bundesliga match on Saturday, Schalke 04's goal-scoring machine was in full force. The team played against dealer and won big, scoring four goals. This decisive victory not only alleviated the team's current debts, but cleared them entirely.

The match began with dealer holding the majority of possession and testing Schalke 04's goalkeeper early on. However, in minute 21, Schalke 04's offense took the lead when defender Benedikt Höwedes headed in a free kick from midfielder Max Meyer. 

Ten minutes later, striker Guido Burgstaller made it 2-0 after a clever assist from midfielder Daniel Caligiuri. The second half continued much like the first, with dealer unable to break through Schalke 04's defense. Then, in minute 77, Burgstaller secured his brace after slotting in a cross from left back Sead Kolašinac. 

The final goal of the match was scored by substitute forward Breel Embolo in minute 89, completing Schalke 04's 4-0 demolition of dealer. This impressive win not only moves Schalke 04 up to 5th place in the Bundesliga table , but also propels them into UEFA Champions League qualification contention . In addition, this result clears the team's debts completely and sets them up for a successful end to the season.

#  Bundesliga striker sends casino bosses packing with blackjack skills 

Bundesliga striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has sent casino bosses packing with his blackjack skills.

Aubameyang, who is the top scorer in the Bundesliga, regularly frequents casinos to play blackjack and other games. However, he has now shown that he is a formidable opponent by beating casino bosses time and time again.

Officials at one casino in Dortmund have admitted that they can no longer beat the striker, who always seems to come out on top.

“We have had countless players come through our doors over the years, but we have never faced anyone like Aubameyang,” said one official.

“He is incredibly consistent and knows what he is doing. He has been giving us a run for our money lately.”

Aubameyang is not just a good blackjack player – he is also a proficient poker player. In fact, he often competes in tournaments and often comes out on top.

His skills at blackjack have now led some people to dub him the ‘blackjack king’.

#  Casino bosses left red-faced after Schalke 04 ace punishes them at blackjack

Just when the casino bosses thought they had the upper hand, Schalke 04 ace Max Meyer dealt them a crushing blow.

Meyer was in town for a friendly against Tottenham Hotspur and decided to make a little side money while he was at it. The 21-year-old football star took on the casino bosses at blackjack and came out on top, leaving them with some red faces.

Meyer is reported to have won €1,000 from the casino bosses, who were no doubt kicking themselves for not spotting his Schalke 04 shirt. The youngster didn't seem too fazed by his win, taking it all in his stride and enjoying a good night's rest before his team's game the next day.

Schalke 04 boss Markus Weinzierl was unsurprisingly delighted with his player's exploits. "Max is an incredibly coolheaded player," he said after Meyer's win. "He always has his feet firmly on the ground."

Meyer will be looking to continue his good form when Schalke 04 take on rivals Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga this weekend.
