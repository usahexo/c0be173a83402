#  What is the objective of the game?

The objective of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

# How do you play the game?

To play the game, each player takes turns drawing a card and placing it on their side of the board. Each card has a different point value, and players can only place cards that are adjacent to other cards on the board. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.

# What are some of the different card types that you can play?

There are three different types of cards in the game: destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Destroyers are worth one point, battleships are worth three points, and aircraft carriers are worth five points.

#  How many different types of zombies are there?

There are many different types of zombies, and it can be hard to keep track of them all! But let's try.

The most common type of zombie is the Romero zombie. Named after horror filmmaker George Romero, these zombies are slow and clumsy, and tend to wander around aimlessly. They're not particularly dangerous, but they can be a nuisance.

Another common type of zombie is the fast zombie. These zombies are much quicker than Romero zombies, and can move surprisingly quickly for their size. They can be a real danger if you're not careful.

Then there are the Infected zombies. These zombies are created when someone is infected with the zombie virus. They look similar to Romero zombies, but they're much quicker and more dangerous.

Finally, there are the Undead zombies. These zombies are corpses that have been reanimated by the zombie virus. They often look like living humans, but with decaying skin and eyes that glow a dull red. They're perhaps the most dangerous type of zombie, because they're incredibly strong and difficult to kill.

#  What kind of power-ups can be found in the game?

There are many different power-ups that can be found while playing the game. Some of these power-ups include a shield that protects the player from taking damage, a magnet that pulls coins towards the player, and an invincibility star that makes the player invincible for a short amount of time.

#  Are there any bonus rounds in the game?

There are a few bonus rounds in the game that can help you win more money. One of them is the free spins round, which gives you between 10 and 15 free spins to help you rack up some extra wins. You can also trigger the bonus round by getting three or more bonus symbols on an active payline. This round will take you to a new screen where you'll have to choose from several different items in order to win prizes.

#  What is the maximum bet amount in the game?

In the game of blackjack, the maximum bet amount is $100. This limit is set by the casino, and it cannot be exceeded by players. The only exception to this rule is when a player has a blackjack, in which case they can bet up to $250.
