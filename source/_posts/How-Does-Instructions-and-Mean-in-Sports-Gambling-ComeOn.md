When choosing which bets to place, always remember to split your bankroll evenly between them. This way, if some of your bets lose, you won’t lose too much money overall. And if some of your bets win, you’ll make a nice profit.

If Chelsea win but Fulham draw or lose, you would still make a profit from your betting activity.

This approach helps to spread your risk around, meaning you’re less likely to lose money if one particular outcome doesn’t go your way. And by betting on several different outcomes simultaneously, you can increase your chances of winning overall.
