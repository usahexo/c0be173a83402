A state lottery is a state-run gambling game. Lotteries are often used to finance public goods such as education and infrastructure.

In some states, lotteries are the only legal form of gambling. In other states, lotteries are one of many forms of legal gambling, which also includes casinos, horse and dog racing, charitable gaming, and video gaming terminals.

The first modern state lottery was established in Pennsylvania in 1970. In the first year of operation, Pennsylvania raised $34 million from ticket sales. In 2017, Pennsylvania’s state lottery raised over $3.5 billion from ticket sales.
