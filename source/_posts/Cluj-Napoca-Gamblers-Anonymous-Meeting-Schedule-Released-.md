#  U-BT Cluj-Napoca Stops Gambling After Wife Finds Out 

Gamblers in the city of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, have been dealt a heavy blow after the municipal government announced a ban on gambling. The clampdown on gambling came into effect earlier this week, after the city’s mayor discovered his wife was addicted to playing slot machines in local casinos.

“My wife and I were going out for dinner one evening when she suddenly asked me to stop at a casino on the way home so she could play the slots. I had no idea she was even into gambling, but when I saw how much money she was losing, I knew we had to take action,” said Cluj-Napoca Mayor Emil Boc in a statement to local media.

Mayor Boc has long been an advocate for responsible gambling, and believes that young people in particular are at risk of developing addictive behaviors if casinos are allowed to operate freely. In order to protect citizens from the harmful effects of gambling, he has now decided to ban all forms of gambling within the city limits.

This move is sure to be welcomed by many locals, who have long complained about the negative impact of gambling on their communities. Gambling can lead to financial hardship, social isolation, and even crime, as desperate gamblers resort to desperate measures in order to get their hands on more money.

The ban on gambling in Cluj-Napoca will hopefully help residents in the city break free from their addiction and lead healthier, happier lives.

#  Gambling Addiction Recovery Tips from Local Recovery Group 

Individuals seeking gambling addiction recovery can benefit from the firsthand experiences of those who have been through the process. 

In order to get started, here are some tips and observations from local gambling addiction recovery group members: 

1. Seek professional help. This cannot be overemphasized. There is no shame in admitting that you have a problem and need help solving it. 

2. Take it one day at a time. Recovery is not a linear process; there will be good days and bad days. The most important thing is to keep moving forward. 

3. Develop a support network. This can include friends, family, professionals, or other recovering addicts. It is important to have people who understand what you are going through and can offer encouragement when needed. 

4. Be honest with yourself and others. This includes admitting how much control gambling has over your life and being willing to talk about your addiction openly. 

5. Avoid triggers whenever possible. If you know that going to the casino always leads to problematic behavior, avoid it! Find other activities that you enjoy and can do without risking relapse. 

6. Be patient with yourself . Gambling addiction recovery is not easy, but it is worth it in the end! Take things one step at a time and celebrate each small victory along the way

#  Breaking: U-BT Cluj-Napoca Caught Gambling Again 

Less than a year after being caught gambling on their own account with skins worth over $5,000, Romanian esports organisation U-BT Cluj-Napoca has been caught gambling again. 

This time, they are alleged to have gambled on a game of Rocket League with skins worth over $10,000. The match took place between two other teams in an online tournament and was streamed live on Twitch. 

The allegations were first made by prominent Rocket League caster and analyst Vikkstar123, who observed the match in question and noticed that one of the players on U-BT's team was using skins that didn't belong to them. 

He then went on to accuse the team of betting on their own game and losing deliberately in order to gain an advantage. U-BT have since denied any wrongdoing, but the evidence against them appears to be damning. 

This isn't the first time that U-BT has been caught up in a gambling controversy. Last year, their Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team was caught using illegitimate account skins to bet on matches. As a result, they were banned from participating in any Valve-sponsored events for two years. 

It's unclear what repercussions U-BT will face this time around, but it's likely that they'll be sanctioned in some way by both Twitch and Rocket League developer Psyonix. Gambling scandals have become a hot topic in the world of esports in recent years and organisations like U-BT can expect to be dealt with harshly by tournament organisers if they're found guilty of wrongdoing.

#  U-BT Cluj-Napoca Reportedly Skips Team Practices to Gamble

According to reports from local media outlet, Gazeta Sporturilor, popular Romanian League of Legends team U-BT Cluj-Napoca is allegedly skipping team practices in order to gamble.

The report cites unnamed sources within the team who allege that some of the players have been spending time at a casino in the city rather than preparing for upcoming matches. The sources also claim that tensions have been high inside the team as a result, with players arguing over practice times and strategies.

U-BT Cluj-Napoca are currently in 4th place in the League of Legends Liga Pro Romania, with a 4-3 record. They are scheduled to play against 5th place Team Dignitas on Friday, but it’s unclear whether they will be ready to compete after reportedly skipping practices.

This is not the first time that a professional League of Legends team has been accused of gambling. In November 2017, Chinese team Edward Gaming were fined $10,000 by Riot Games for betting on matches involving other teams.
