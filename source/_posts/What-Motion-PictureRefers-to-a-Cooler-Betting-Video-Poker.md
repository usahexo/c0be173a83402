Video Poker is one of the most popular casino card games. It's easy to learn, but offers plenty of opportunities to strategic players to gain an edge over the house. If you're looking to increase your chances of winning at video poker, check out these tips:

# 1: Learn the Game

One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning at video poker is to learn the game inside and out.

Not all video poker machines are created equal – some offer better odds than others. When playing on a machine that offers bad odds, it's important to adjust your strategy accordingly. For example, if you're playing on a machine that only pays out 6 coins for a full house, it's not worth holding any pairs – just discard them and hope for three-of-a-kind or better. Conversely, if you're playing on a machine that pays out 9 or 10 coins for a full house, it might be worth holding onto pairs in the hopes of getting four-of-a-kind or better. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the payout schedule for each type of machine before playing.
