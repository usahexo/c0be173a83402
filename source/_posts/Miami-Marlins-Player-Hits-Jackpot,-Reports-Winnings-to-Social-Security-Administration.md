#  Miami Marlins Player Hits Jackpot, Reports Winnings to Social Security Administration

MIAMI, FL - Marlins outfielder Daniel Robertson hit the jackpot this weekend when he reported his $1.2 million winnings from the Florida Lottery to the Social Security Administration.

Robertson, who has played for the Marlins since 2009, is the team's fourth-highest paid player this season with a salary of $6.25 million. The 30-year-old said he plans to use his winnings to pay off his mortgage and student loans.

"I'm just really happy that I can finally take care of my family and my debts," Robertson said in a press conference on Monday. "It's been a long time coming."

Robertson is not the only Major League Baseball player to hit it big in the lottery. In 2012, then-New York Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran won a $5 million jackpot with a ticket he bought in Puerto Rico.

Despite their large salaries, many professional athletes choose to collect their winnings in one lump sum instead of receiving payments over time. This can be a smart financial decision, as lottery winnings are often taxed at a higher rate than regular income.

For example, if Robertson had chosen to receive his winnings in annual payments over 20 years, he would have received about $58,000 per year after taxes. However, by taking the lump sum payment option, Robertson will receive a one-time payout of $1.2 million that is largely tax-free.

Whether you're an athlete or not, it's always important to consult with a financial advisor before claiming your lottery winnings. There are many important factors to consider when deciding how to collect your prize money, including taxes and future expenses.

#  Marlins Star Ensures All Gambling Winnings Are Reported and accounted For

The Miami Marlins have had a difficult season, but they may have one of their star players to thank for ensuring that all gambling winnings are accounted for. Giancarlo Stanton, the slugging outfielder for the Marlins, recently confirmed that he reports any gambling income to the team and to the MLB.

Gambling on baseball is a common practice, with many fans betting on games either through licensed sportsbooks or through underground bookies. While there is no evidence that Stanton has ever gambled on baseball, his decision to come forward and ensure that all gambling winnings are reported will likely set an example for other players in the league.

In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of players being caught betting on baseball games. In some cases, players have even been banned from the game for life after being caught. And while Stanton's decision may not prevent every player from engaging in illegal gambling activity, it does send a message that such behavior will not be tolerated by the league.

MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has made efforts to clean up the sport of baseball in recent years, and this latest move by Stanton helps to further that goal. With more and more states legalizing sports betting, it is important for the MLB to take steps to ensure that the integrity of the game is maintained. And with Stanton setting an example for other players, it appears that the MLB is headed in the right direction.

#  MLB Player Hit it Big at the Casino, Straight to SSI

It’s not unusual for professional athletes to enjoy a night out at the casino. In fact, for some players, gambling is a regular hobby. However, for MLB outfielder Kevin Kiermaier, his recent trip to the casino resulted in a much bigger score than he likely ever imagined.

Last week, Kiermaier visited the Cosmopolitan Casino in Las Vegas and put all of his chips on black in roulette. To his amazement, the ball landed on black – again and again. In the end, Kiermaier walked away with over $100,000 in winnings!

While some may see this as a lucky fluke, Kiermaier is convinced that he has a special touch when it comes to gambling. In fact, he’s been known to make occasional trips to Las Vegas specifically to test his luck at the casino tables. And so far, it seems like he’s been pretty successful!

So what does Kiermaier plan to do with his windfall? The first order of business is obviously to pay off some of his massive debts. After that, he plans to invest in some property and set up a trust fund for his young daughter.

Kiermaier’s impressive casino win is just another example of how athletes can make serious money when they hit it big. In fact, many former sports stars have turned to gambling as a way to make additional income after their careers are over. And with lucrative opportunities like this available, it’s no wonder that so many people are drawn to the world of professional gambling.

#  Miami Marlins Ballplayer Hits Pay Dirt with Revenue Reporting to SSA

The Miami Marlins ballplayer Nelson Cruz has been doing very well for his team this year. As July winds down and teams gear up for the playoffs, Cruz is batting an astonishing .314, putting him among the top players in the league. What’s even more impressive is that he was able to make such a significant contribution to his team while maintaining full compliance with his employer’s revenue reporting obligations to the Social Security Administration (SSA).

Cruz is one of a growing number of employees who are using modern payroll technology to ensure that their annual wage reports to the SSA are accurate and timely. By using a cloud-based solution like Paylocity’s PayFocus, Cruz was able to submit all of his wage data directly to the SSA on a regular basis. This eliminated any need for him to manually enter data into a government website, and it also ensured that there were no errors or delays in getting his wage information onto the SSA’s records.

In addition to its ease-of-use, Paylocity’s PayFocus also offers taxpayers several important benefits. For example, it allows employers to quickly and easily identify any discrepancies between their internal payroll records and those reported to the SSA. This can be helpful in identifying potential issues before they become larger problems.

Cruz’s success underscores the importance of having accurate and timely wage data in order to remain compliant with government regulations. Thanks to modern payroll technologies like Paylocity’s PayFocus, it has never been easier for employers or employees to meet these requirements.

#  Reporting Casino Winnings to Social Security Administration

As a U.S. citizen, you are required to report any income earned in a taxable year to the Social Security Administration (SSA). This includes gambling winnings. Gambling winnings are considered taxable income and must be reported on your annual tax return.

If you have won more than $1,200 at a casino or other gambling venue, you will likely receive a Form W-2G from the establishment. This form reports the amount of your winnings and the tax withheld. You will also be issued a Form 1099-MISC if the winnings are paid in cash.

You are responsible for reporting all gambling winnings on your annual tax return, regardless of whether or not you receive a Form W-2G or Form 1099-MISC. The amount of taxes you owe on your gambling winnings depends on your overall taxable income for the year.

For most taxpayers, gambling winnings are taxed as ordinary income. However, if you lose money gambling, you can usually claim this loss as a deduction on your tax return. The amount of the deduction depends on how much money you lost and how long you've been keeping track of your losses.

The SSA requires U.S. citizens to report all taxable income, including gambling winnings. It's important to understand how these winnings are taxed so that you can appropriately report them on your tax return.
