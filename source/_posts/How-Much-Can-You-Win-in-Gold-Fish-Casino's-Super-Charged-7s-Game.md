Gold Fish Casino's Super Charged 7s game is a three-reel, five-payline progressive slot game with a $0.01 minimum bet and a $5.00 maximum bet. The game offers a top prize of up to 10,000 coins.

To play the Super Charged 7s game, you first need to choose your coin value. There are six coin values to choose from: $0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $1.00, and $5.00. Next, you need to choose the number of lines you want to play (up to 5). Finally, you need to choose how many coins you want to bet per line (1â€“5). So, for example, if you choose a coin value of $0.10 and 3 lines played with 2 coins per line, your total bet would be $6 ($0.10 x 3 lines x 2 coins per line).

The Super Charged 7s game has the following paytable:

Symbol 1 Coin 2 Coins 3 Coins 4 Coins 5 Coins 7 100 200 500 1000 4000 BAR 25 50 75 100 125 Cherry 10 20 30 40 50 Gold Fish 5 10 15 20 25

As you can see from the paytable, the highest paying symbol is the 7 symbol. If you hit three 7 symbols on an active payline, you will win 1,000 coins (or 10,000 coins if you're playing max bet). Other high paying symbols include the BAR symbol and the Gold Fish symbol.

#  How Is the Winnings Amount in Gold Fish Casino's Super Charged 7s Game Calculated?

 Gold Fish Casino is a renowned online casino that offers an amazing selection of slot games. One of the most popular slot games on the site is Super Charged 7s. This game is based on the classic slot machine layout and mechanics, but it features a few twists that make it more exciting and lucrative. One of the most notable differences is that players can win up to 1,000 times their bet amount. But how is this possible? How is the Winnings Amount in Gold Fish Casino's Super Charged 7s Game Calculated? Let's take a closer look.

First and foremost, it's important to understand how the game works. Super Charged 7s uses a three-reel layout with five pay lines. Players can bet one, two or three coins on each pay line, and the amount they bet multiplied by their coin denomination determines their total wager amount. For example, if a player bets one coin at a value of $0.05, their total wager will be $0.15. The payouts in the game are as follows:

One Coin Two Coins Three Coins

1x 2x 3x

2x 4x 6x

3x 6x 9x

4x 8x 12x

5x 10x 15x


The highest payout in the game is 1,000 times the player's bet amount, which is awarded when they hit three 7s on an active pay line while betting three coins. So how does this payout work? When a player hits this jackpot, their total wager is multiplied by 1,000 to determine their winnings amount. For example, if a player hits the jackpot while betting $0.50 per spin (three coins at $0.05 each), their winnings will be $500! Pretty impressive!


While hitting the jackpot is surely the dream, there are plenty of other lucrative payouts available in Super Charged 7s as well. In fact, even smaller wins can result in some serious profits thanks to the game's multiplier feature. This multiplier increases with each successive winning spin and can reach as high as x5. With this feature in mind, it's easy to see how players can rack up some impressive winnings amounts even if they don't hit the jackpot itself.
