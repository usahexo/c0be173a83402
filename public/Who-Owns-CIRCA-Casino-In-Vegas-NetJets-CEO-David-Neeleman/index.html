NetJets CEO David Neeleman"></a>Who Owns CIRCA Casino In Vegas? NetJets CEO David Neeleman</h1><p>CIRCA, the new $1.5 billion casino in Vegas, is owned by NetJets CEO David Neeleman. The revelation was made when a permit application for the project was made public.</p>
<p>Neeleman is the founder of JetBlue Airways and has a net worth of $2.3 billion. He purchased the former New Frontier casino in 2016 for $pakUNknown and has been redeveloping it into Circa.</p>
<p>The project is expected to create 4,000 jobs and has been met with some opposition from residents of the nearby historic district, who are concerned about increased traffic and noise.</p>
<p>Neeleman is no stranger to gambling ventures; he also owns the M Resort in Henderson, Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Circa-Las-Vegas-Casino-Sold-To-NetJets-CEO-David-Neeleman-For-486-Million"><a href="#Circa-Las-Vegas-Casino-Sold-To-NetJets-CEO-David-Neeleman-For-486-Million" class="headerlink" title="Circa Las Vegas Casino Sold To NetJets CEO David Neeleman For $486 Million"></a>Circa Las Vegas Casino Sold To NetJets CEO David Neeleman For $486 Million</h1><p>In a blockbuster deal, Circa Las Vegas casino has been sold to NetJets CEO David Neeleman for $486 million. </p>
<p>The 41-acre property, which includes a 300-room hotel and a 20,000 sq. ft. casino, was purchased by Neeleman through his company Alandalus Property Holdings. </p>
<p>A statement from Alandalus said that the purchase is part of an effort to create a “world-class luxury destination” in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>“We are committed to creating a world-class luxury destination experience in Las Vegas and this acquisition is an important step in that direction,” said Neeleman. “Circa is a distinctive and iconic property and we are excited to bring our vision for its future to life.” </p>
<p>Neeleman – who is also the founder of JetBlue Airways – did not disclosed what his plans are for the property, but said that he will be making “significant investments” in it. </p>
<p>The sale comes as a bit of a surprise, as Circa had been on the market since last year with an asking price of $1 billion. It’s unclear why the property failed to sell at that price point, but Neeleman’s purchase could potentially signal an uptick in interest in the Vegas market. </p>
<p>“The sale of Circa underscores the continued demand for top-tier properties in Las Vegas,” said Donslot Siegel, president of global gaming and hospitality at brokerage firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield. “This deal also demonstrates that investors are willing to pay premium prices for gaming assets with strong upside potential.”</p>
<h1 id="CIRCA-Las-Vegas-Sold-To-NetJets-CEO-David-Neeleman-What-Does-This-Mean-For-The-Future"><a href="#CIRCA-Las-Vegas-Sold-To-NetJets-CEO-David-Neeleman-What-Does-This-Mean-For-The-Future" class="headerlink" title="CIRCA Las Vegas Sold To NetJets CEO David Neeleman - What Does This Mean For The Future?"></a>CIRCA Las Vegas Sold To NetJets CEO David Neeleman - What Does This Mean For The Future?</h1><p>Las Vegas is a city that is constantly changing and evolving. New businesses, hotels, and attractions are popping up all the time, and it seems like there is always something new to explore. Recently, there was some big news in the city when it was announced that CIRCA Las Vegas had been sold to NetJets CEO David Neeleman. This got people wondering what this means for the future of CIRCA and for Las Vegas as a whole.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this purchase by Neeleman is a big one. He is a very successful businessman who has a lot of experience in the aviation industry. So, what does he plan to do with CIRCA? No one really knows for sure, but there are some speculations.</p>
<p>One possibility is that Neeleman will make some big changes to CIRCA and try to turn it into an even more luxurious destination than it already is. He could may investments in things like further expansion, additional amenities, and even more exclusive events. This could make CIRCA even more popular than it already is and bring in even more visitors to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Neeleman may choose to focus on expanding the reach of CIRCA outside of Las Vegas. There are already plans in place to open up locations in places like New York City and Miami, and Neeleman could choose to ramp up those efforts. This could help expose even more people to CIRCA’s unique brand of luxury and give them a chance to experience what the hotel has to offer.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s anyone’s guess as to what Neeleman will do with CIRCA Las Vegas. But one thing is for sure - his purchase of the property definitely has the potential to change the landscape of the city’s luxury scene.</p>

<p>Neeleman is no stranger to the casino industry, having founded several casino companies in the past. His latest venture, CIRCA, is a new kind of casino that focuses on “the experience” over traditional gambling.</p>
<p>CIRCA will be the second largest casino in Las Vegas once it’s completed, and it is expected to create thousands of jobs in the city.</p>
<p>Neeleman plans to open other CIRCA casinos in other cities across the United States.</p>
<h1 id="CIRCA-Casino-Sold-to-NetJet-CEO-David-Neeleman-What-Will-He-Do-With-It"><a href="#CIRCA-Casino-Sold-to-NetJet-CEO-David-Neeleman-What-Will-He-Do-With-It" class="headerlink" title="CIRCA Casino Sold to NetJet CEO David Neeleman - What Will He Do With It?"></a>CIRCA Casino Sold to NetJet CEO David Neeleman - What Will He Do With It?</h1><p>Casino gaming company CIRCA has been acquired by NetJet CEO David Neeleman. This move is in line with Neeleman’s strategy of investing in travel and hospitality businesses. What will he do with CIRCA?</p>
<p>CIRCA was founded in 2014 by two casino industry veterans, Bill Benter and Tony Dale. The company has become known for its innovative technology that allows customers to bet on a wide variety of outcomes, including sports, politics, and entertainment.</p>
<p>Neeleman is no stranger to the casino industry. He is the founder of JetBlue Airways and co-founder of Azul Brazilian Airlines. In addition to his experience in the travel and hospitality industries, Neeleman also has a strong track record in casino gaming. He is the founder of Gaming &amp; Entertainment Properties Trust, one of the largest casino landlords in the United States.</p>
<p>The acquisition of CIRCA by Neeleman is a good fit for both companies. For CIRCA, it provides access to capital and expertise in running a successful casino business. For Neeleman, it gives him a foothold in the rapidly growing online gambling market.</p>
<p>What will Neeleman do with CIRCA? There are several possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>He could continue to operate CIRCA as a stand-alone company. This would give him exposure to the growing online gambling market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>He could merge CIRCA with his existing casino gaming company, Gaming &amp; Entertainment Properties Trust. This would create a larger company with a stronger presence in the online gambling market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>He could sell CIRCA to another company or private equity firm. This would provide liquidity for CIRCA’s shareholders and access to new markets for Neeleman.</p>
</li>
</ol>
